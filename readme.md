# ITSE121 Project - Simple Compiler with C

This project is aimed at creating a simple compiler using the C programming language. The compiler will be able to parse a given source code and generate executable machine code.

## Introduction

In this project, we will be implementing a basic compiler
 <!-- that can perform lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. The compiler will take a source code written in a specific programming language and produce an executable binary file. -->

## Features
<!-- 
- Lexical analysis: Tokenizing the source code into meaningful tokens.
- Syntax analysis: Parsing the tokens to check for correct syntax.
- Semantic analysis: Checking for semantic errors and generating symbol tables.
- Code generation: Generating machine code from the parsed source code.
- Error handling: Providing meaningful error messages for easier debugging. -->

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/itse121-compiler.git`
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Build the project using the provided build script.
4. Run the compiler on a sample source code file.

## Usage

To use the compiler, run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    $ ./compiler <source-file>
    ```
